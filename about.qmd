## Bio

Iâ€™m an all things data professional living in Colorado Springs, currently working in healthcare supporting their provider network infrastructure. Previously I worked in tech doing product analytics and data science. Prior to that I worked in aviation simulating passenger traffic through airport facilties.

I'm passionate about making things more efficient, and a proponent of working with what tool and environment works best for you. Designing designing solutions that are inclusive for everyone is something I enjoy.

In my free time I love exploring the outdoors, climbing, yoga, snowboarding, and spending time with my wife, dogs, and cat (if she lets me).
